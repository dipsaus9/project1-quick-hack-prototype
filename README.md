# Planner subway Amsterdam
In this project I created a Planner for the subway in Amsterdam, including the new subway 52. This project uses the Google location API and the Mapbox for creating a map with markers. You can search your own adress, subway station or other adress by filling in the input fields. The input fields give a suggestion based on your input. Your input can be a Zipcode, an adress or a placename. By clicking the submite button you can find your route.
